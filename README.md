expercise_stop_watch
====================
This program allows you to do interval training. It is made up of two stop watches and an interval counter. The first stop
watch is used for your training time and the second for your rest period. You could setup intervals to repeat the train and 
rest periods for as many times as you like. Also, there is an alarm between train & rest and then again between rest & train.

To use the program you need to download python and simpleguitk.
